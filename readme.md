# LLM Lab
This lab will have you send your first programmatic API call to an LLM.

# Files to modify
The code you should modify, as well as the instructions for completing the lab, are
in main/lab.py.

# ChatGPT
This lab leverages an external connection to ChatGPT. It is possible that it may become
inaccessible due to an invalid API key or the service being unavailable. You can check
this by running the sanity_test test case in the labtest.py test class. The environment
variables you should use for the connection should either be automatically configured
for you upon opening the lab, or will be explicitly provided.
